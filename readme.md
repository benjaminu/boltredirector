### Info

BoltRedirector is wicked little extension designed for [Bolt 2.0](//bolt.cm) and up that allows you to perform any pre-app `301 Moved Permanently` redirects. Kinda handy when you're moving from your silly flat file website/overly complicated CMS to Bolt. :wink:

This version of Redirector requires at least Bolt 2.0, due to the re-modelled extensions interface and methodology. The old extension (0.9.2) has been removed.

To install the extension, use the extensions manager in Bolt. The extension is filed under `foundrycode/boltredirector`. You can also just search-ahead for 'redirector', and it'll pop up.
